riverpod  + MVC

Architecture Explanation:
For this project, I implemented the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture alongside Riverpod for state management.

MVC Architecture:

Separation of Concerns: MVC helps maintain a clear separation between the business logic (Model), user interface (View), and user interaction (Controller). This approach ensures that each component of the app is independent, making it easier to modify or extend the app in the future.
Code Maintainability: By structuring the app using MVC, the codebase remains organized and modular, which simplifies debugging, testing, and future enhancements.
Riverpod for State Management:

Scalability: Riverpod offers a more scalable solution for managing state compared to traditional approaches like Provider. It supports advanced features such as dependency injection and provides better control over state lifecycles.
Improved Testing: With Riverpod, testing becomes easier since it doesnâ€™t rely on the Flutter widget tree to function. This decouples state management from the UI, leading to more manageable and testable code.
Challenges and Solutions:
One of the key challenges I faced during development was learning and implementing testing. I tackled this by thoroughly researching Flutter's testing framework and progressively developing unit tests for different parts of the app. This process helped me build confidence in the app's stability and allowed me to catch bugs early in the development phase.

Bonus Features:
As a bonus, I implemented integration testing to ensure that all components of the app work well together, simulating real user interactions and verifying end-to-end functionality.
